Welcome to the DevConf 2.0 Website

# Installation
If you are on Windows see the then you need Ruby `choco install ruby` and node `choco install nodejs`.

The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so you need to install that first with `gem install jekyll`.

Once done you also need to run `gem install jekyll-redirect-from` to install the dependencies.

Next install the development tools with `yarn install`

# development

```
yarn start
```

# compile
  
To compile it is
```
jekyll build
```
  
You can swop `build` for `serve` to run the web server which does incremental updates as you change files.
